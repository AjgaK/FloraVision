**Created by:** Iga Kordula

**Date:** 13.01.2025  
## Overview
FloraVision is an Android application developed as part of my engineering thesis at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology (PJATK). The app identifies plant species based on flower images using a machine learning model trained on Azure AI Custom Vision and deployed via TensorFlow Lite. It provides offline, real-time classification of 16 different flower species.
